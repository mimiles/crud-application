# Products App

Welcome to the instructions guide for the Products App. It is an easy to use app to help keep track of your grocery store's inventory. You perform a variety of tasks, including:

  1. List: displaying a list of products
  2. Show: show information about a specific product in the inventory
  3. Create: add a new product to the database
  4. Update: edit an existing product (name, aisle, department, and/or price)
  5. Destroy: delete an existing product

Additional instructions are available when you run the Python script: products_app.py. Enjoy!
